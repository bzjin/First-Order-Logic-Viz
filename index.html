	<h1>Tableaux Visualized </h1>
	<h4> Beatrice Jin CS4860 Fall 2016 Final Project </h4>

	<h2> Purpose </h2>
	<p> It is obviously not difficult to "hard-code" several elements to be placed in a certain arrangement on a computer screen. The challenge of this project was to find an appropriate way of "automating" the process such that any formula could be an "input" that has a standardized output. This project takes these inputs and visualizes them according to Tableaux rules, in browser. This points to the subject of <em>automated reasoning</em> we discussed in class - mainly related to proof assistants. This project does not attempt, however distinguish valid formulas from invalid formulas. The code does not truly make <em>conclusions</em>, even though it does some reasoning; rather, its purpose is to <em> print</em>. In this project, the first three examples used in the two methods are valid formulas. The fourth example is an invalid formula.</p>

	<h2> About Tableaux </h2>
	<p> A tableaux proof for a formula <span class="true">X</span> is constructed by iteratively decomposing the root tableau <span class="false">FX</span> until it is complete. If the resulting tableau is closed, tableaux has essentially given us a "counterexample", so the formula must be true "by contradiction." If the tableau does not close, the original formula is not true. A tableau can be decomposed by applying either an α-rule or a β-rule.</p>

	<p>The α-rules decompose as follows: </p>
	<ul>
		<li class="true">T(X∧Y)<br>TX<br>TY</li>
		<li class="false">F(X∨Y)<br>FX<br>FY</li>
		<li class="false">F(X⇒Y)<br><span class="true">TX</span><br>FY</li>
		<li class="true">T(¬X)<br><span class="false">FX</span></li>
		<li class="false">F(¬X)<br><span class="true">TX</span></li>
	</ul>

	<p> And the β-rules decompose as follows (β-formulas are underlined throughout the visualization): </p> 
	<ul>
		<li class="false"><span class="beta">F(X∧Y)</span><br>FX<br>FY</li>
		<li class="true"><span class="beta">T(X∨Y)</span><br>TX<br>TY</li>
		<li class="true"><span class="beta">T(X⇒Y)</span><br><span class="false">FX</span><br>TY</li>
	</ul>

	<p> We see that every rule decomposes the formula, so the process must eventually terminate.</p>

	<h2> The Original Tableaux Method </h2>
	<p> The simplest method of decomposing a formula is by top-down order and mark them off as used. The function written for this method is called <span class="function">originalTableaux</span>. The formulas are decomposed in a "depth-first" order, such that each formula is decomposed to either <span class="true">TX</span> or <span class="false">FX</span> before another formula is decomposed. </p>

	<div id="chart" class="col-md-12"></div>

	<h2> Block Tableaux </h2>
	<p> The original tableaux method is makes it difficult for the human eye to keep track of the formulas that have and haven't been decomposed. One way of redesigning tableaux decomposition is to support local reasoning, where each formula is still a node, but each β-formula decomposes into two nodes, side by side. The function written for this method is called <span class="function">blockTableaux</span>. </p>

	<p>Like in the original Tableaux method, the formulas are also decomposed in a "depth-first" order. This is most visibly evident when we see the "staggered" heights of decomposed formulas. For example, in the third "proof" for the statement <span class="true"> ((¬ P ∧ ¬ Q) ⇒ ¬ (P ∨ Q))</span>, we see that <span class="true">T(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q)</span> is decomposed in full, and <em> then </em>the decomposition of <span class="false">F¬ (P ∨ Q)</span> is done, below it. In terms of user interface, it is easy to see when a tableaux is closed because the simplest formulas, <span class="true">TX, FX</span>,are on the bottom of the branches.</p>

	<h2> Challenges in this Project </h2>
	
	<h3> Translating Formulas into Input Arrays</h3>
	<p> The first challenge that presented itself in this project was how to translate formulas into readable "strings." It was important that the code should easily be able to traverse through a formula, understand which signs and rules (<span class="function">∧, ∨, ⇒, ¬</span>) were attached to which sub-formulas. It therefore did not suffice to feed the code a simple string that reads from right to left, like <span class="true">((P ⇒ P) ⇒ P)</span>.</p>

	<p> The final solution I settled on was to use nested arrays. In the source code, they take the form: <span class="function">[boolean, rule, [formula(e)]]</span>, where boolean is <span class="function">T, F</span>, rule is <span class="function">∧, ∨, ⇒, ¬</span>, and formula(e) is either formula or another nested array. For example, the statement <span class="true">((P ⇒ P) ⇒ P)</span> is coded into the array <span class="function">[["F"], ["⇒"], [["⇒"], ["P"], ["P"]], ["P"]]</span>. This structure asks the input source (the user, or me, in this case) to pre-emptively assign and group the sub-formulae. Essentially, the user must do the work to write and properly nest each sub-array. However, this input method does not ask the user to assign truth values to anything except the falsification of the first formula. The code still does "automated reasoning." </p> 

	<p> A small disclaimer is due here: there does exist a pre-existing sub-library in D3 that supports nested arrays, called <a href="http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/tree.html">d3-hierarchy</a>. This sub-library contains layout algorithms for visualizing hierarchical data, typical to most languages that support parent/child data structures. It would have supported breadth-first traversal, which is an advantage over the depth-first traversal problems that we see in block tableaux. I wrote my own code because it directly compares the original and block tableaux methods, while sacrificing some visual vertical dissonance in the block method.</p>
	
	<h3>Calculating Coordinates, not Validity</h3>
	<p> This project was designed to <span class="bold"> print and display </span> the steps of logical reasoning. The code "remembers" the formula and its place in the decomposition of formula only because the main function is iterative and ends only when the helper function <span class="function">printer</span> splits the string input enough times - not because each formula has an index. That is, in the original tableaux method code, the function does not know what the "level" is while it prints out a decomposed formula. It only knows its level because the y-position (<span class="function">yPos</span>) of the text svg element is changed. This also means that the <span class="function">printer</span> function in the code does not remember the formula, and therefore cannot directly tell us whether a branch is closed. </p>

	<p>Instead, we know that a branch is closed by intuition - when the formula that is printed is <span class="true">TX</span> or <span class="false">FX</span>. The function <span class="function">TF</span> is only place we identify what the formula is before it is pointed to the 8 helper functions (<span class="function">trueAnd, falseOr, falseThen, trueNot, falseNot, falseAnd, trueOr, trueThen</span>) for printing. <span class="function">TF</span> therefore cannot change the text that's printed. We work our way around this by assigning and then reassigning the variable <span class="function">now</span> to the most recently created text element. Then, when a β-formula is identified, it retroactively assigns the style <span class="function">text-decoration: underline</span> to <span class="function">now</span>. Note that regardless of printing format or decomposition method, the formula always finishes decomposing into its most basic components, <span class="true">TX</span> or <span class="false">FX</span>. </p>

	<h3>A Printing Function and Its Advantages</h3>
	<p>We return now to the point brought up in the introductory purpose statement, that the code does not draw conclusions. That is, the code will print the decomposition of every formula, regardless of whether it is valid. We see this in the fourth example used in each of these methods, <span class="false">F((P ⇒ Q)⇒ (¬Q ⇒ P))</span>. The formula is fully decomposes into <span class="false">FP, FQ, FP,</span> and<span class="true"> TQ</span>. Notice that <span class="true">TP</span> is not among these formulas, and therefore we cannot contradict <span class="false">FP</span>, and therefore we also cannot contradict the original falsified statement. </p>

	<p> Allowing the code to print the full tableaux decomposition is useful it that we can see not only which formulas cannot be true, but also to have a full counterexample that makes the formula false. For instance, in the example above, we know that letting P and Q be false lets us trace back and conclude <span class="false">F((P ⇒ Q)⇒ (¬Q ⇒ P))</span> to counter the original statement. This is like a "shortcut" to a truth table; instead of performing the casework and guessing at whether P and/or Q are true and/or false, we can pull out the aforementioned case right away.</p>
